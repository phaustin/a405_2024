We next consider quantities conserved under reversible moist adiabatic processes. As we assume reversibility, the heterogeneous system must be in phase equilibrium at all times. In this case the total entropy $(s)$ is conserved.

By analogy to (4.5.2), the total specific entropy (entropy per unit mass of dry air) may be written
$$
s=s_d+r s_v+r_l s_l,
$$
where $s_d$ is the specific entropy of dry air, $s_v$ is the specific entropy of water vapor, and $s_l$ is the specific entropy of liquid water.
Writing the Clausius-Clapeyron equation as
$$
L_v=T\left(s_v^*-s_l\right),
$$
where $s_v^*$ is the specific entropy of water vapor in equilibrium with liquid water, and substituting this into (4.5.6) gives
$$
s=s_d+r_t s_l+\frac{L_v r}{T}+r\left(s_v-s_v^*\right)
$$

Using the definitions of secific entropies:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& s_d=c_{p d} \ln T-R_d \ln p_d, \\
& s_v=c_{p v} \ln T-R_v \ln e \\
& \left.s_v^*=c_{p v} \ln T-R_v \ln e^*,\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
and
$$
s_l=c_l \ln T
$$

(4.5.7) may be written
$$
\begin{aligned}
s=\left(c_{p d}+\right. & \left.r_t c_l\right) \ln T \\
& -R_d \ln p_d+\frac{L_v r}{T}-r R_v \ln (\mathcal{H}) .
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the last term vanishes when the air is saturated $(\mathcal{H}=1)$ and also in the limit of $r \rightarrow 0$, reaching its maximum magnitude for intermediate $\mathcal{H}$. The quantity $s$, defined by (4.5.9), is conserved under reversible moist adiabatic transformations.

It has become conventional to express entropy in terms of an equivalent potential temperature $\theta_e$, which is defined so that
$$
\left(c_{p d}+r_t c_l\right) \ln \theta_e \equiv s+R_d \ln p_0,
$$
where $p_0$ is a reference pressure. Substituting (4.5.9) gives
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \theta_e=T\left(\frac{p_0}{p_d}\right)^{R_{t l} /\left(c_{p l}+c_l r_t\right)} \\
&(\mathcal{H})^{-r R_v /\left(c_{p, l}+c_l r_t\right)} \exp \left[\frac{L_v r}{\left(c_{p d}+c_l r_t\right) T}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

When $r=0, \theta_e=\theta$, the potential temperature
