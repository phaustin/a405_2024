# ATSC 405: Cloud physics and chemistry

Term 2, 2018, MWF 9-10am, EOSC Main 203

- For lecture notes and matlab code bookmark the main site is
  <https://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/courses/atsc405>

*Catalog entry*: Atmospheric thermodynamics, cloud chemistry and
microphysics. Computer modeling of droplet growth, convection, and
mixing. Application of differential equations to atmospheric problems.

*Description*: This course focuses on how to observe and understand
cloud processes, including mixing and convection, rain formation,
thunderstorms and cloud/climate interactions. It also introduces Python
programming and the use of numerical methods to solve simple
differential equations. If you need a computer lab account, see the main
office for a handout on how to pay the \$25 lab fee.

*Pre or co-requisites*: Classical thermodynamics (PHYS 203 or CHEM 205)
and introductory ordinary differential equations (MATH 215). and
familiarity with a programming language.
