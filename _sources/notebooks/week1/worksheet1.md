# Week 1 worksheet

Three problems from Lohmann Chapter 1

+++ {"user_expressions": []}

1) Assume a low level cloud with the following properties: vertical extent 1.5 km, horizontal
extent 1 km, cloud droplet number concentration 90 $cm^{−3}$ air and mean diameter 10
μm. Estimate the mass of the cloud by assuming that all the cloud droplets are spherical
and have the same size. Take 1000 $kg\,m^{−3}$ to be the density of water.

2) Imagine a pure water cloud which consists of cloud droplets of uniform size with $R_d$
=5 μm. Assume a uniform spacing of the cloud droplets, with a number concentration of
Nc = 170 $cm^{-3}$

   (a) Calculate the average distance between the cloud droplets
   
   (b) What would happen to the distance if the number concentration was trippled?

3. The average pressure at Earth’s surface is 985 hPa. Knowing the radius of the Earth
$r_{Earth}$ = 6370 km and using the definition of pressure, estimate the total mass of the
atmosphere.
