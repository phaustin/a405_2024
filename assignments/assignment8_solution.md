Questions 1 and 2: The two problems at the bottom of the {ref}`marshall_palmer` notebook


Question 3: Lohmann problem 4 page 250:

  - Mixed-phase clouds contain ice crystals as well as liquid droplets. Consider such a cloud at a temperature $T=-4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, pressure $p=800 \mathrm{hPa}$ and a humidity which corresponds to supersaturations with respect to ice of $5 \%$ and with respect to water of $1 \%$. In the cloud, an ice crystal and a droplet both grow by diffusion, each starting from mass $m_0=10^{-8} \mathrm{~g}$. The ice crystal is a thin hexagonal plate, so that its capacitance can be approximated by $C=2 r_i / \pi$, where $r_i$ is the radius of the ice crystal.

  (a) Determine the times it takes for the droplet and the ice crystal to grow to a total mass $m_1=1.1 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~g}$. You can neglect solution and curvature effects when calculating the droplet growth. For the ice crystal, you can assume that its mass $m_i$ and diameter $d_i$ are related by $m_i=\alpha d_i^3$, with $\alpha=1.9 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$.

  (b) Which of the two cloud particles grows faster? Explain the main reason for the difference in growth speed.

  (c) How would the situation in the mixed-phase cloud change for supersaturation with respect to ice but subsaturation with respect to water? Explain qualitatively in a few sentences.
