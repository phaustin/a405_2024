    "  - Mixed-phase clouds contain ice crystals as well as liquid droplets. Consider such a cloud at a temperature $T=-4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, pressure $p=800 \\mathrm{hPa}$ and a humidity which corresponds to supersaturations with respect to ice of $5 \\%$ and with respect to water of $1 \\%$. In the cloud, an ice crystal and a droplet both grow by diffusion, each starting from mass $m_0=10^{-8} \\mathrm{~g}$. The ice crystal is a thin hexagonal plate, so that its capacitance can be approximated by $C=2 r_i / \\pi$, where $r_i$ is the radius of the ice crystal.\n",

    "  (a) Determine the times it takes for the droplet and the ice crystal to grow to a total mass $m_1=1.1 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~g}$. You can neglect solution and curvature effects when calculating the droplet growth. For the ice crystal, you can assume that its mass $m_i$ and diameter $d_i$ are related by $m_i=\\alpha d_i^3$, with $\\alpha=1.9 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$.\n",
