## Buoyancy and stability

i)  (3pt) Our by-now familiar air parcel of moist (but non-cloudy)
air has a temperature of 24.9 deg C. It is neutrally buoyant sitting in an
environment that has a temperature of 25 deg C and a mixing ratio of 10
$g kg^{-1}$. What is the mixing ratio in the air parcel?

```{code-cell} ipython3
#your code here
```

ii (2pt) the temperature of the air parcel is increased by 1 deg C, so
that it is no longer neutrally buoyant. Assuming the resulting
acceleration is maintained (i.e. constant) for 10 seconds, what is the
final parcel velocity?

```{code-cell} ipython3
#your code here
```

iii (2 pt) Dry air at 1000 hPa is measured to have a temperature of
27oC, while at 900 hPa the temperature is 22 deg C, is this layer of the
atmosphere dry stable, neutral or unstable?

```{code-cell} ipython3
#your code here
```

## Fog

In this question, for simplicity, assume the definition of relative humidity 
defined in terms of mixing ratio: RH = $r_v/r_{vsat}$

i (2pt) The environmental air with temperature of 25.0 deg C and a mixing
ratio of 10 $g kg^{-1}$ is located near the surface at a pressure of
1000hPa. What is the relative humidity?

 ii (1pt) The air starts to cool isobarically at night until eventually a fog forms. Assuming the pressure is 1000 hPa. What is the
 temperature at which the fogs occurs? (Use the tephigram to answer
 this, please mark the answer on the tephigram)

iii (2pt) Derive this same temperature by inverting Tetonâ€™s formula,
showing your working. (Out of interest note how close the answer is to
your tephigram result).

iv (1pt) What is the common name given to this temperature?

```{code-cell} ipython3
# your code here
```

##  Relative humidity

In this question, for simplicity, assume the definition of relative
humidity defined in terms of mixing ratio.

i (2pt) A parcel of air at time t=0 has a temperature T0 of 25 deg C and a
relative humidity RH of 0.1. What is the mixing ratio $r_{v0}$?

ii (4pt) The parcel is cooled and moistened isobarically by the evaporation of precipitation to reach a final temperature 
of $T_1$ and a final mixing ratio of $r_{v1}$.  Use a rootfinder to solve for $T_1$ if the relative humidity is RH=0.6.

```{code-cell} ipython3
#your code here
```

## New: Two compartment mixing

- Consider two compartments, each with a volume of 1 $m^3$, separated by a rigid, perfectly insulating membrane.

- Initially $T_A$ = 300 K and $p_A$ = $10^5$ Pa, and $T_B$ = 100 K and $p_B$ = $10^3$ Pa.  Suppose the membrane breaks.  Find the final temperature and pressure in the 2 $m^3$ compartment.   Does the total entropy change?  By how much?

## New: Taylor series

+++

Find the second order taylor series expansion for the following functions:

1) $(1 + \delta)^{-3}$
2) $\log(1 + \delta)$
