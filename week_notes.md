# Week notes

## Lecture 2, week 1, Thursday:  

- Read Lohmann chapter 1 and scan the questions at the end of the chapter

- My slide show: [slides on boundary layer clouds and climate](https://phaustin.github.io/talks/cloud_talk.html)

### Learning objectives

  - Identify principal cloud types
  - Explain how clouds can both heat and cool the planet
  - Work some simple scaling problems about clouds

## Lecture 3, week 1, Friday

- Thompkins through page 8
- Finish {ref}`worksheet1`
- Do the adiabatic box assignment (due Friday)

### Lecture 3 Reading notes

- Thompkins equation 1.7

    \begin{align}
    pV &= NkT \\
    p &= \rho R_d T
    \end{align}

  - ideal gas is enormous simplification -- all that matters is the number of moles $N$, not the character of the molecules

- Thompkins equation 1.9 -- first law for internal energy

    \begin{align}
    du &= dq + dw \\
    du &= dq - p\,dv
    \end{align}

  - heating and working are verbs not nouns -- they are path dependent processes, while internal energy, temperature, pressure, entropy etc. are path independent state variables with perfect differentials.  The integral of a state variable is path independent.

- Thompkins equation 1.25 first law for enthalpy

    \begin{align}
    dq &= c_p\,dT - v\,dp \\
    dh &= dq + v\,dp
    \end{align}
    
  - the enthalpy version of the first law depends on temperature and pressure.  This is the most useful for atmospheric scientists, because we can easily measure both those state variables
